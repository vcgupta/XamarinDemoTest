Requirements:
LoginPopUp page should open as a model page in Xamarin from Native code or PCl code.

Issue: LoginPopUp is opened in background of current activity in android, rather then on top of it.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open XamarinDemo.Droid project in Android emulator/device
2. Click on "OpenLogin Model" button, it will open model popup - works fine on Xmarin PCL
3. Close the model popup
4. Click on 'Open Native Activity' This will Start and open an activity defined in Native Xmarin.Android project
5. Click on button there, to open Login Model window. Now this opens the popup but in behind of current activity.
   If you back press of current activity, you will see the Popup is opened. Same can be seen from Debug log for Login popup.
